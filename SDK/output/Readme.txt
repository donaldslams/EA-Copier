SDK Version 1.0.0.1
2024/04/18

This SDK demonstrates how to use the powerful Fortex trading system through the Fortex API service with an API key. The entirety of the service is wrapped in a Windows DLL with a rich set of APIs. The DLL is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

With a single connection, the user gains access to:
1. Full market data support: streaming quote and market depth updates, and historical chart data.
2. Complete trading service: retrieving account equity, margin, tickets/positions, pending orders, and entering orders/open/close tickets.

The SDK provides sample codes to use the SDK in:
1. C++, 32-bit and 64-bit.
2. MetaTrader MQ4, 32-bit. This enables traders to copy the trade in an MT Terminal to the Fortex system. It opens up all possibilities.
